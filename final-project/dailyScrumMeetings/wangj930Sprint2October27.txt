What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on command, pwd, part of history and some other classes
    - worked on exceptions and error handling
    - talked with group to finalize design ideas

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish error handling
    - finish directory, file, ls and cd classes and commit 
    - try to get a functioning product


Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to communicate on division of tasks of important classes like mkdir, directory stack, etc. and finish those, before a product can be created.
