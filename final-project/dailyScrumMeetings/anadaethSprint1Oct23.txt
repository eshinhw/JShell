What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Implementation and structure of the CRC Cards 
    - Brainstormed ideas with my group for the necessary parent classes
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Understanding the structure more so it will be easy to code using inheritance and polymorphism
    - Look at how to begin coding the view history command

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Checking if there are any invalid commands for looking at previous history
