What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Parts of the MockJshell
    - JUnit command tests for multiple commands
  

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finishing the MockShell
    - Finishing the JUnit tests for the rest of the commands
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Hard coding the parts of the mockshell
    - Trouble shooting errors that are occuring in the JUnit testing
