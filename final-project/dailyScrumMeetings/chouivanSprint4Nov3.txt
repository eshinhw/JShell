What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Finished all bugs with mkdir
	- Made pathToCurrent determine fullpath or relative
	- Made Ls work with fullpaths
	- Make cd work with fullpaths
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	-Update CRC cards
	- make pathToCurrent work with path edge cases


Am I blocked on anything?
    -none
