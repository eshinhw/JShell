What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finalized our structure for the JShell with the group
    - Attempted to work on the history command
    - Getting familiar with inheritance and polymorphism
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Begin coding the Pushd command
    - Begin coding the Popd command

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I was blocked on figuring out the history command which I said I would
    previously work on. So instead I passed it on to my teammate and it works
    better since it fits in with other work they are doing
