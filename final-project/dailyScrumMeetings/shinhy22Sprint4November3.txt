What did I work on in the last three days? 

- worked with teammates to figure out ways to handle absolute path and relative path provided from a user.
- tested the program with different input scenarios to find out any bugs or things to fix before the demo.
- 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- start implmenting codes related to error handling so that whenever the program encounters an error, it prints the message to a user instead of terminating the program.
- finish up pushd command before the demo.
- continue testing the program with different input scenarios to fix any bugs or unexpected outputs.

Am I blocked on anything? 

- we are not blocked on anything at this stage.
