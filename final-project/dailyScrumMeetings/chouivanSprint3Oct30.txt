What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Fished helper function called pathtocurrent
    - Finished roughly mkdir
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
	- finish debugging mkdir
	- finish ls


Am I blocked on anything?
    - a helper function that can find out if path is relative or full
