What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Work on search command, try to finish it.
    - continue to make redirection on new commands like tree, ls-r, search
    - help on mv, cp, rm commands

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Work on finalizing junit test for search
    - Help group mates with anything they need
    - Work on making sure all test cases are run correctly
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Right now, there is a test case not working for search. I asked group mates about it, and they are not able to figure out the issue. I will need look into this more, since search works on the terminal.
