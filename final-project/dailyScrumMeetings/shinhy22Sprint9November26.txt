What did I work on in the last three days? 

- Worked on tree command to traverse the entire file system and ls command to implement additional recursive feature.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- Make sure the commands that I have worked on so far work without errors by running some testing on them.
- Try to apply generics to our project.
- Help teammates implement other commands like mv and cp
- Get ready to run some extensive testing with JUnit
- Take care of little details of the project before the due date

Am I blocked on anything? 

- Everything works well.
