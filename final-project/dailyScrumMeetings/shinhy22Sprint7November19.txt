What did I work on in the last three days? 

- Started working on rm
- Learned about object serialization for saveJShell and loadJShell commands
- updated JShell to work with new commands from a user

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- Apply object serialization to fully implement saveJShell and loadJShell commands
- Brainstorm ways to implement tree command

Am I blocked on anything? 

- Everything works well.
