What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished on javadocs for all classes
    - Worked on some commenting for our code
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Testing the commands for edge cases
    - Trying to break the code
    - Error handling implementation 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Thinking outside of the box for possible cases we might miss
