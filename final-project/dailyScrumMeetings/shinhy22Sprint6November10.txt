What did I work on in the last three days? 

- Created helper methods related to absolute and relative path of a directory and a file
- Worked on ls command to print out file name when file path is provided as an argument of ls command
- Continuously tested the program to find any bugs

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- Today is the end of Assignment2A, and we are pretty much done with all command functionalities of the shell
- Keep working on testing the program for possible errors

Am I blocked on anything? 

- Everything works well.
- Try to look for possible edge cases which may crash the program.
