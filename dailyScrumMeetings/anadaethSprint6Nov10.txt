What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Lots of testing, trying to break the shell
    - Fixed some parts of the code that were breaking with different cases
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Testing even more
    - Trying to break the code
   	- Finishing up any last things what we may have missed

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Trying to think of possible scenario's that may break our shell
