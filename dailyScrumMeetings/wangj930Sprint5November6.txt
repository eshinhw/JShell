What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on helping group members with path related commands and implement full and relative path echo
    - make sure all commands are functional and work with full path
    - make sure cd works with .. and .
    - make sure to test for errors and edge cases

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - work on singleton design principles and make sure to only have 1 fileSystem
    - make sure to capitalize class names
    - make a abstract class for command exception
    - make an interface for fileManager
    - make sure to test for errors and edge cases
    - work on error handling and make sure the commands use an error handling class 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Currently, I changed some class names and package structure is changed, so I need to update that to svn, and make sure the group has it before proceeding with anything else.
    - Need to have the error handling classes functional before we can deal with test cases
