What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on echo, cat and several other commands and 
 fileSystem, and directory and other classes
    - confirmed solutions in terms of class structure and fixed bug issues
    - tried various ways to implement error handling 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - work on helping group members with path related commands
    - make sure all commands are functional
    - make to test for errors and edge cases, and check rubric for things to test

Am I blocked on anything?
    - we need to have commands functional before testing errors
