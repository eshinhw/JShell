What did I work on in the last three days? 

- worked on the basic functionalities of JShell like getting input commands from a user, parsing them and check if they are valid.
- constructed a commandHashMap we learned from lab6 so that an instance of each individual command class can be created using java reflection. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- continue working on JShell so that it can collaborate with individual command class files.
- starts implemeting bodies of individual command classes.

Am I blocked on anything? 

- we should finish working on command interface file so that each individual command class can correctly implement it.
- we still need to figure out classes related to file system like file, directory and path.
