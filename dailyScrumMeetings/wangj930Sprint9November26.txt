What did I work on in the last three days?
    - work on generics, and implementing it in validator class
    - helped teammates that need help (with mock file manager, and testing)
    - help teammates in recursive function related commands (ls)
    - make sure that redirection works with new commands, fix issues
    - discussed ways to make design better and implement commands more effectively

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Work on search command, try to finish it.
    - continue to make redirection on new commands like tree, ls-r, search
    - help on mv, cp, rm commands
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - right now, I need a recursive function that will work with search, which another member worked on. I need to make this work with any given path and find a single file or directory name.
