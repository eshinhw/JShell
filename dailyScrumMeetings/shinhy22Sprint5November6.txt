What did I work on in the last three days? 

- worked on pwd and history commands to handle edge cases which had caused errors before.
- implemented codes related to error handling so that users gets informed about errors they may encounter while using the program.
- tried to come up with possible edge cases for program testing 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- I will work on identifying different kinds of errors and figuring out how to handle them and inform users.
- I will try to improve overall structure of the program applying important programming concepts learned from the course.
- I will come up with as many edge cases as possible to identify possible edge cases we might have missed.

Am I blocked on anything? 

- Everything is going pretty well so I am not blocked by anything.
