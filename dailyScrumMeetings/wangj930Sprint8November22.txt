What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on some redirection functions
    - work by helping group members for functions they have trouble with
    - write some code for ls, and generics in a function that will recurse through the directory.
  

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Work on unit testing and mock file system
    - Work on the recursive function
    - Work on the search command
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Right now, I need to know what another group member did for a particular function in unit testing mock fs to be able to make progress.
