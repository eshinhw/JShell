What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on Sprint and Backlog 
    - brainstormed ideas with my group for the JShell, and various commands in terms of design
    - worked on design ideas with CRC cards
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - work on JShell and other classes like file, directory
    - start coding commands like history, ls

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to allow the user to input commands and do error checking, which currently is not implemented to have commands
    - Need the Jshell to memorize previous commands
