What did I work on in the last three days? 

- worked on finalizing history and man commands so that it works well with JShell and display the correct outputs.
- worked on creating a fileManager class which contains all necessary methods to inspect command arguments and run command classes correctly. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- works on retrieving full or relative paths of an file and directory object.
- starts adding comments and javadocs for command classes that are completed.

Am I blocked on anything? 

- we still need to figure out directory structure and work on several commands that require file and directory paths.
