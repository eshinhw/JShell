What did I work on in the last three days? 

- Finished working on saveJShell and loadJShell commands to make sure they work correctly

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

- Make sure saveJShell and loadJShell work with different filepath inputs.
- Finish brainstorming ways to implement tree command and start coding some ideas.

Am I blocked on anything? 

- Everything works well.
